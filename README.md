Homework #1 4-29
Sarah Wist

I did this project in order to put into practice what I've learned of HTML and CSS.

I updated all of the alt tags in the HTML from basic <div> tags to specific HTML semantics.

I replaced the <div> tags in order to make the webpage accessible to the visually impaired and allows software to read the webpage.
